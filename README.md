Learn Basic JavaScript : 

• implement JavaScript data types, built-in methods, and variables

• use conditionals to control the flow of a program in JavaScript

• construct functions and pass data through them

• identify global and block-level scopes in JavaScript

• use arrays to store lists of data

• use loops to execute blocks of code multiple times

• use iterator methods to simplify the process of looping over arrays

• use JavaScript ES6 object syntax to model real-world items

Learn Basic DOM :

Register events to DOM elements using the addEventListener() method.

The addEventListener() method takes two arguments: an event type and an event handler function.

When an event is triggered on the event target, the registered event handler function executes.

Event handler functions can also be registered as values of onevent properties of their event target.

Event object properties like .target, .type, and .timeStamp are used to provide information about the event.

The addEventListener() method can be used to add multiple event handler functions to a single event.

The removeEventListener() method stops specific event handlers from “listening” for specific events firing.
