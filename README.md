Learn Basic JavaScript : 

• implement JavaScript data types, built-in methods, and variables

• use conditionals to control the flow of a program in JavaScript

• construct functions and pass data through them

• identify global and block-level scopes in JavaScript

• use arrays to store lists of data

• use loops to execute blocks of code multiple times

• use iterator methods to simplify the process of looping over arrays

• use JavaScript ES6 object syntax to model real-world items

Learn Basic DOM :

• The document keyword grants access to the root of the DOM in JavaScript

• The DOM Interface allows you to select a specific element with CSS selectors by using the .querySelector() method

• You can access an element directly by its ID with the .getElementById() method which returns a single element

• You can access an array of elements with the .getElementsByClassName() and .getElementsByTagName() methods, then call a single element by referencing its placement in the array

• The .innerHTML and .style properties allow you to modify an element by changing its contents or style respectively

• You can create, append, and remove elements by using the .createElement(),.appendChild() and .removeChild() methods respectively

• The .onclick property can add interactivity to a DOM element based on a click event

• The .children property returns a list of an element’s children and the .parentNode property returns the element’s closest connected node in the direction towards the root


Learn Basic DOM events :

• Register events to DOM elements using the addEventListener() method

• The addEventListener() method takes two arguments: an event type and an event handler function

• When an event is triggered on the event target, the registered event handler function executes

• Event handler functions can also be registered as values of onevent properties of their event target

• Event object properties like .target, .type, and .timeStamp are used to provide information about the event

• The addEventListener() method can be used to add multiple event handler functions to a single event

• The removeEventListener() method stops specific event handlers from “listening” for specific events firing
